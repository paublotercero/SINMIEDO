      <p> [PABLO LAGUNAS: SIN MIEDO]
        Inspired by my parent's past and their original roots, this piece is a tribute and symbolization of both my mom and my dad.Both of my parents are originally from Mexico, yet both of their states are vastly different, which can also be said about their personalities and their character. Yet despite their differences, I like to believe those different qualities they hold have shaped me into the person that I am today. This piece is meant to represent their differences.. differences that are not necessarily a bad thing. They are both represented as the sun and the moon, extremely different yet still admirable. 
The title of this piece is derived from a phrase my parents and I use to move forward and also as a way to live, the phrase in English is translated to " without fear ".
